# Pure Data Playground
This is my central site for all instruments, components, and larger systems I'm creating using Pure Data. Pure Data is an open source visual programming language for multimedia created by Miller Puckette, the author of Max/MSP. More information about Pure Data can be found here: https://puredata.info/.
